This package contains utility functions for invoking and managing the VICE emulator, with a
focus on `x64`.

As of right now, it is hyper-minimal and only contains a ridiculously simple function for
launching `x64` with a program argument, that absolutely does not deserve its own package.

But there are plans. BIG plans. GRANDIOSE PLANS.
For the future.
